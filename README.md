# Spring-boot-rest
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is developed by Roy Thomas Fielding, who also developed HTTP. The main goal of RESTful web services is to make web services more effective. RESTful web services try to define services using the different concepts that are already present in HTTP. REST is an architectural approach, not a protocol.
